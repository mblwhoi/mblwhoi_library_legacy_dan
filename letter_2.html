					<p><font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF">Hello Don! No matter how many years I haven't written to you,
					still I hove to start in the usual way. How are you? One. day toward
					the end of last year, Lieutenant Coe dropped in, bringing your message.
					He came all the way from Tokyo in a jeep and must be quite tired for he
					didn't stay long. But we gathered enough information about you and we
					were quite happy</font></p>
					<p><font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF">We got another friend here. Can you guess who it is? Edwin Helwig.
					But since he has been away from home for three years, the informations
					we can get through him are slightly stale. .......</font></p>
					<p><font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF">In the last four: years, we simply had lots of things But ducking
					under bombs was not so bad. Rather it was a great excitement. Hide and
					seek at the expense of your life can't help being exciting. There was,
					however, an awful side to it too.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF">During first three years of the war, our everydwy life was not
					fundamentally affected and we could work regularly. Then, in January,
					a year ago from now the Japanese navy took over the station and changed
					it to a temporary submarine base. As a result, the laboratory moved to
					a near-by village Although, we succeeded in getting a wooden building
					built, we had a hard time to install sea-water pumps and so forth. When
					the war was over, the American troops occupied the station, for the
					reason that the Japanese navy had been there. When American officers
					came there for the first time to take over the place I went there.
					It was a funny experience. On one side of a long table three American officers
					were sitting and on the opposite side two Japanese navy
					officers and I were sitting. They served beer and canned asparagus with
					tomato ketchup. This slightly cute menu made me smile. But, oh boy
					the both sides were pretty much excited. I am sure they were really
					scared of each other. They yelled whatever they wanted to say at the
					top of their voice but never listened to the other side. And an
					interpreter translated off and on, paying no attention whether it made
					sense or not. I was partly absorbed in watching the chaos and partly in
					the asparagus and was still partly absorbing the beer . Neither side
					understood the other. But to start with neither side knew what they were
					going to say. Toward the end I was loudly laughing which nobody
					noticed. Somehow the meeting came to end. So I started to work. I
					stuck to a major and explained to him that this building originally
					belonged to the University etc., etc . In ten minutes he began to see
					the situation. As soon as I saw the sign of dawning in his chaotic
					mind, I ran back to the building, wrote a poster asking soldiers to take
					good care of the place because it is a research institute, pasted it on
					the wall and took leave from the back door leaving the noisy bunch
					there. There wan no way to know what influence the poster exerted on
					the American soldiers who came there. But to my greatest surprise in a
					copy of over-sea edition of Time issued in the beginning of December, I
					came across my own words all printed. Moreover, it had a title &quot;Appeal
					to Gothe&quot;.</font></p>
